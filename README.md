# Simple On-Chain Game (Rock Paper Scissors)

## Description

A decentralized Rock Paper Scissors game built on the Aptos blockchain using Move smart contracts. This project demonstrates how classic games can be implemented on-chain with real cryptocurrency betting, ensuring transparent and tamper-proof gameplay.

The smart contract allows two players to engage in the traditional Rock Paper Scissors game with the following features:

- **Trustless Gaming**: No central authority needed - the blockchain handles all game logic
- **Real Money Betting**: Players can bet APT tokens on game outcomes
- **Transparent Results**: All moves and results are recorded on the blockchain
- **Fair Play**: Smart contract logic ensures no cheating or manipulation
- **Instant Settlement**: Winners receive payouts automatically through the contract

### How It Works

1. **Game Creation**: Player 1 creates a game by choosing their move (Rock/Paper/Scissors) and setting a bet amount
2. **Game Join**: Player 2 joins by making their choice and matching the bet
3. **Automatic Resolution**: The smart contract determines the winner using classic RPS rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Paper beats Rock  
   - Scissors beats Paper
4. **Payout**: Winner takes both bets, or in case of a tie, both players get their original bets back

## Vision

Our vision is to pioneer the integration of traditional gaming with blockchain technology, creating a new paradigm for digital entertainment that is:

- **Completely Transparent**: Every game action is publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Provably Fair**: Mathematical certainty that no player can cheat or manipulate outcomes
- **Globally Accessible**: Anyone with an Aptos wallet can play, regardless of location
- **Truly Decentralized**: No servers, no downtime, no central control
- **Financial Sovereignty**: Players have complete control over their funds and winnings

We believe this represents the future of gaming - where players can engage in familiar games with real stakes, backed by the security and transparency of blockchain technology.
